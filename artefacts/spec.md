## Background

Have a look at bazi-chart-a.html and bazi-chart-b.html first, it gives you a perfect idea what the app we will build will yield based on giving date and time as input. We will call this chart template from now on.

The app will have two views. First view is the initia view.

In the initial view, the user inputs date and time for birth, and selects the branches and stems from drop down menus, and the chart is created based on that. 

The second view is exactly, perfectly matching, to what the chart template renders now, only with the difference that it is dynamic based on the data that the user inputs.

I've given you stem-mappings.csv and branch-mappings.csv that give you data that you need for generating any chart. 

Remember, visually, we must 100% honor the chart template.

The visuals for the initial view should be stunningly stylish exactly like in the chart template. 

The api should be FastAPI.

Once you have familiarized yourself with everything, ask any questions you may want to clarify before moving on.
